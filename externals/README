External dependencies for the rewrite branch. This package is only necessary to
run pywikibot from a fully self-sufficient (no other dependencies other than
python 2.6+) directory. This is especially useful on Windows.

Usually - under normal circumstances - these packages should be installed 
separately elsewhere in the OS by the standard package managing system.

If you want to run the rewrite as a stand-alone package, please also download
the contents of the externals/ subdirectory. Furthermore this includes git
repos and zip archives like:

* parse-crontab: Parse and use crontab schedules in Python - Version .14
    (from https://github.com/josiahcarlson/parse-crontab)
    Checkout the gip repository and copy the 'crontab' dir into the path
    'externals/crontab' afterwards.

* lunatic-python: Two-way bridge between Python and Lua - Version 1.0
    (from http://labix.org/lunatic-python)
    Download the zip archive and unpack the 'lunatic-python-1.0' dir into the
    path 'externals/_lua' afterwards.
    $ wget http://labix.org/download/lunatic-python/lunatic-python-1.0.tar.bz2
    $ tar -xvf lunatic-python-1.0.tar.bz2 
    $ mv lunatic-python-1.0 _lua
    Patch package dir in order to work with newer lua (>= 5.1) versions
    $ patch -p1 -d [path-to-install-dir]/_lua < [path-to-externals]/patch-lua
    and you are done.
    For the sake of completeness, the command invoked to create the patch was:
    $ diff -Naur lunatic-python-1.0 _lua > patch-lua
