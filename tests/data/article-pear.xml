      <text xml:space="preserve">Pears are [[tree]]s of the [[genus]] &lt;em&gt;Pyrus&lt;/em&gt; and the edible [[fruit]] of that tree.
The pear is an important fruit in temperate regions. Like the [[apple]], the pear fruit is a [[pome]]. There are thousands of domesticated pear varieties.

There are many species of pears. The most important for fruit production are &lt;em&gt;Pyrus communis&lt;/em&gt; (European pear or simply pear) and &lt;em&gt;Pyrus pyrifolia&lt;/em&gt; (Asian pear or apple pear). Other species are used as rootstocks for European and Asian pears and as ornamental trees.

Unlike most fruits, European pears do not ripen on the tree. They must be picked and, sometimes, subjected to cold, before they will become sweet and soft. They store well in their mature but unripe state if kept cold. Asian pears are sweet on the tree and are eaten crisp.

Pears are consumed fresh, canned, and as juice. Fermented pear juice is called [[perry]].
