To install the Pywikipediabot framework:

1)  Extract/unzip this package to a directory on your computer.
2)  Open a command prompt in that directory, and run the command:

        python setup.py install

This will install the package to the "site-packages" directory of your Python
installation.  Linux/Unix users may need to add "sudo" at the beginning of the 
command line to get access to the site-packages directory; or, they can
install the package to a different location by running:

        python setup.py install --home=/path/to/location

where "/path/to/location" is the directory that you want the Pywikipediabot
files installed to.

Note: You will need to have an active Internet connection when you run the
setup script, in case the installer needs to download other modules required
by the framework.
