spellcheck script
-----------------
**This bot spellchecks wiki pages.** (:phab:`T236642`)

The script is checking whether a word, stripped to its 'essence' is in
a given list or not. It does not do any grammar checking or such.
For each unknown word, you get a couple of options::

    numbered options: replace by known alternatives
    a: This word is correct; add it to the list of known words
    c: The uncapitalized form of this word is correct; add it
    i: Do not edit this word, but do also not add it to the list
    p: Do not edit this word, and consider it correct for this page only
    r: Replace the word, and add the replacement as a known alternative
    s: Replace the word, but do not add the replacement
    *: Edit the page using the gui
    g: Give a list of 'guessed' words, which are similar to the given one
    x: Ignore this word, and do not check the rest of the page

When the bot is ended, it will save the extensions to its word list;
there is one word list for each language.

The bot does not rely on Latin script, but does rely on Latin punctuation.
It is therefore expected to work on for example Russian and Korean, but not
on for example Japanese.
